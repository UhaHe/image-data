# image-data
This dataset was taken by Dr. Wenjun Zhou (zhouwenjun@swpu.edu.cn) in Image Processing and Parallel Computing Laboratory ,School of Computer Science, Southwest Petroleum University,China.

Original imagrs: the  images of sample #1 to #9 in different illumination (low, normal, high), 
for example, #1-2 means the image of object#1 captured in normal illumination.

Reference objects: the images of referece objects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in different illumination (low, normal, high),
in our experiment, we use the images of file #1-2 as the references (captured in normal illumination).

Target samples: the images of target samples #2 to #9 in in different illumination (low, normal, high), 
in our experiment, we use the images of file #4 as a test.

IP: the images of IP.
